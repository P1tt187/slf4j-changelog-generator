# slf4j-changelog-generator
This Repository generates a changelog file for slf4j so it can be parsed by tools like renovate

# Why?
I use renovate and annoyed that slf4j publishes its changelogs on a html page.

To fix this this script generates a changslog entry for every entry on the html page where slf4j publishes their changelog https://www.slf4j.org/news.html
